                <h3>1. Book in Minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    Using our website or mobile app, enter your contact info, vehicle details, location, fuel type, and payment method. For non-subscribers,
                    we’ll place a <strong>$25 temporary hold</strong> to verify funds, but you won’t be charged until fueling is complete. For subscribers, you simply login with your phone and email address

                <p>
                    Once you book, a driver confirms your exact delivery time within your chosen window. You’ll get a text 
                    <strong>2 hours before</strong> your time slot with a precise fueling time. <br>
                    <em>Note: Bookings must be made at least 2 hours in advance.</em>

                <p>
                    Make sure your car is unlocked and the gas cap is accessible when or shortly after the driver arrives. If the car is locked or the gas cap inaccessible the driver will text, email and call the customer.
                    Our drivers will wait up to <strong>5 minutes</strong> after that, they must leave and the service fee is non-refundable.
