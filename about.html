<h1>Who are we? </h1>
<p1 class="intro-text">
                
We’re a group of passionate Pittsburgh entrepreneurs driven by the grit, pride, 
                and resilience that define our city. With deep roots in the local community and a shared vision for innovation, 
                we’ve come together to build something new — something that solves real problems and makes life easier for the people around us. 
                We come from different backgrounds — tech, logistics, design, and beyond — but we’re united by a common goal: to bring bold ideas to life and create lasting impact right here in the Steel City.
