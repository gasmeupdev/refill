            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Enter your contact information, vehicle details & location, fueling preference and payment information. 
                As the amount of fuel needed is an estimate, you will not be charged for the fuel and service until the fueling is complete. 
                However, we may place a fixed $25 temporary authorization hold (a "pending" charge) to ensure sufficient funds are available. </p>
            <p>After you’ve completed your booking, a driver will confirm your fuel delivery for the time range you’ve selected. 2 hours before your 
                delivery window begins you’ll receive a message notifying you of the exact estimated time of arrival of our driver. Bookings must be made 
                in advance of 2 hours. </p>
            <p>Once the driver arrives, please ensure your vehicle is unlocked and the fuel cap is accessible. If the vehicle is locked the driver will 
                wait 5 mins for the owner to unlock their vehicle. The service fee will not be refunded in the event of no shows/ locked cars after the 5 
                minute expiration.
                <br> 
                After the fueling is complete the driver will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the vehicle is properly locked and the gas cap is securely shut.</li>
                <li>Record the actual amount of fuel dispensed.</li>
                <li>Charge the customer and process the full payment</li>
            </ul>
