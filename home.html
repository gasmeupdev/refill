                <h3>1. Book in Minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    Enter your contact info, vehicle details, location, fuel type, and payment method. 
                    Weâ€™ll place a <strong>$25 temporary hold</strong> to verify funds, but you wonâ€™t be charged until fueling is complete.

                <h3>2. Get Notified</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you book, a driver confirms your delivery window. Youâ€™ll get a text 
                    <strong>2 hours before</strong> your time slot with a precise ETA.<br>
                    <em>Note: Bookings must be made at least 2 hours in advance.</em>

                <p>
                    Make sure your car is unlocked and the gas cap is accessible. 
                    Our driver will wait up to <strong>5 minutes</strong> if the car is locked â€” after that, the service fee is non-refundable.

                <ul>
                    <li>Weâ€™ll lock your vehicle and secure the gas cap</li>
                    <li>Record the exact amount of fuel dispensed</li>
                    <li>Process your final payment</li>
