<h1>Pricing</h1>
<p class="intro-text">
                We’ve built our pricing model to be as fair and transparent as possible, because we believe customers deserve honesty, not hidden fees or surprises. With us, you’ll always know exactly what you’re paying for.
            </p>
<div class="info-cards">
<div class="card animated">
<h2>1. Non-Subscriber Checkout</h2>
<p>A <strong>$25 temporary</strong> hold is placed on your credit card at checkout to verify available funds. 
                        After fueling is complete, you’ll be charged a <strong>$15 service fee </strong> plus the <strong>cost of the gasoline.</strong>
<em>Note: We sell gas at cost — you pay exactly what we pay.</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="card animated">
<h2> 2. Subscribers</h2>
<p>Subscribers pay a <strong>$25 recurring monthly fee </strong> and enjoy fuel delivery with <strong> no service fee.</strong> You’re only charged for the <strong> actual cost of the gasoline at each fill-up </strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="card animated">
<h2> 3. Become a Subscriber</h2>
<p>Signing up is easy. When placing your <strong>first fuel order</strong>, 
                        simply select <strong>“Yes”</strong> when prompted to subscribe at checkout. 
                        Your <strong>$25 monthly subscription</strong> will begin with your first order and renew every 30 days thereafter.

</p>
</div>
<div class="card animated">
<h2> 4. Secure Payment Processing</h2>
<p>All payments are securely managed by <strong>Stripe, Inc.</strong>, 
                        a trusted and accredited third-party payment processor. 
                        Stripe handles all authorization, 
                       <strong> authentication, and payment execution,</strong> ensuring your information is safe and transactions are seamless.</p>

<h2> How it Works</h2>
<div class="info-cards">
<div class="card animated">
<h2>Book In Minutes </h2>
<p>
                        For non-subscribers, enter your contact info, vehicle details, location, fuel type, fill up time and payment method. We’ll place a $25 temporary hold to verify funds, but you won’t be charged until fueling is complete. Subscribers simply need to enter their phone number and email address and then enter the location of their car for fuel up.

<h2> Fuel Delivery</h2>
