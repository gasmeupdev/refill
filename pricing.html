                    <p>A <strong>$25 temporary</strong> hold is placed on your credit card at checkout to verify available funds. 
                        After fueling is complete, you’ll be charged a <strong>$15 service fee </strong> plus the <strong>cost of the gasoline.</strong>
                    
<em>Note: We sell gas at cost — you pay exactly what we pay.</em>.</p>

                <p>
                    Enter your contact info, vehicle details, location, fuel type, and payment method. 
                    We’ll place a <strong>$25 temporary hold</strong> to verify funds, but you won’t be charged until fueling is complete.

                    Our driver will wait up to <strong>5 minutes</strong> if the car is locked — after that, the service fee is non-refundable.
